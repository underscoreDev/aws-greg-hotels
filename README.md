Deploy Static Website on AWS

In this project, I deployed a static website to AWS using S3, CloudFront, and IAM.
The website has been configured with IAM and S3-buckets policies, and Securely delivered its content with low latency and high transfer speeds using CloudFront.

The website can be accessed via the following links:

1. The Cloudfront Domain name - https://d3eonu6tfk931x.cloudfront.net/

2. The website endpoint - http://greg-hotels-680634876032.s3-website.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/

3. Access the bucket object via its S3 object URL - http://greg-hotels-680634876032.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html
